/**
 * No-op release marker for v1.0.0 — inaugural Packagist release.
 *
 * Establishes the always-a-patch discipline adopted across all ETechFlow
 * modules after the NDE v1.7.0 Keystation deploy incident: every release
 * ships at least one data patch so `setup:upgrade` always has something
 * to register in `patch_list`, surfacing FS / permissions / DI errors
 * during the patch phase (which retries cleanly) instead of at the end
 * of the upgrade (which doesn't).
 *
 * Going forward, every release of this module ships at least one patch.
 * If a release has no real data migration to do, this template gets
 * copied/renamed (`V101ReleaseMarker`, `V110ReleaseMarker`, etc).
